## Game Description:

Mega Bomberman is a video game in the Bomberman series. In the single-player mode, the character has to move around the stage placing bombs that destroy everything in their path within a certain range, including enemies, stage objects, and the player himself, something to keep in mind. As the player goes through a series of stages, with a boss at the end of each one, he will recover five pieces to reunite the five separate parts of the earth.
